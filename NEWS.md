# svFlow 1.2.1

-   Some functions that are redundant with functions in {rlang} are eliminated: `as_quosure()`, `is_quosure()` and `is_bare_formula()`

# svFlow 1.2.0

-   The package is renamed svFlow because there is another flow package on CRAN.

-   The function `._()` is moved from {svMisc} 1.3.1 into here. Now, it creates or overwrites `.` and `.call` objects in the calling environment to match the behavior of `%>.%`.

# flow 1.1.0

-   Internal reworking, no change in R code.

# flow 1.0-0

-   First version of the package.
