{svFlow} manages pipeline workflow through a simple pipe operator `%>.%` that, on the contrary to base R pipe operator `|>` and {magrittr} operator `%>%` imposes to *always* specify where left-hand side of the operator should be injected in the right-hand side expression with a `.`. This conveys more clearly the intentions of the programmer and it is less error-prone.

Another pipe operator `%>_%` is more complex. It uses {proto} objects to embed several variables in the pipeline in a way that trhe non-standard evaluation (tidyverse's "lazyeval") is done in an easy and natural way.

## Installation

### Latest stable version

The latest stable version of {svFlow} can simply be installed from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org):

``` r
install.packages('svFlow')
```

### Development version

Make sure you have the {remotes} R package installed:

``` r
install.packages('remotes')
```

Use `install_github()` to install the {svFlow} package from Github (source from **main** branch will be recompiled on your machine):

``` r
remotes::install_github("SciViews/svFlow", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

R should install all required dependencies automatically, and then it should compile and install {svFlow}.

## Usage

Make the {svFlow} package available in your R session:

``` r
library("svFlow")
```

Get help about this package:

``` r
library(help = "svFlow")
help("svFlow-package")
vignette("svFlow") # None is installed with install_github()
```

For further instructions, please, refer to these help pages at <https://www.sciviews.org/svFlow/>.
