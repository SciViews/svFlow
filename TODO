# flow To Do list

* Complete examples for ?flow and ?pipe_operator.

* More tests.

* Refine the repo README.md file: explanation of what it does + examples +
  hexsticker.

* Transparent lazyeval mechanism for ... (equivalent of quos(...)) + `!!`()
  outside of lazyeval + name_ = also outside, or with something else than a name

* Ambiguity of name_ in assignation (name__ for both "assign to flow and make
  quosure"?)

* Use same root for all Flow objects.

* Functions to work inside the flow, pass() or skip(), ... in the pipeline.

* pipe_debug() => true debugging, possibly with arg

* pipe_show() or pipe_stepin(), or ...?

* as_s3() to convert a Flow object into S3?

* "branches", + merge, etc.

* Integrate with drake?

* A specific function to get parent. Now, we use fl$parent.env().

* Add expr as argument to Flow object. May be add possibility to redefine
  environment for methods? flow(.) vs flow(.value) when passing a flow object.

* Complete the tutorial vignettes.
