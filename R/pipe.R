#' Flow pipeline operators and debugging function
#'
#' Pipe operators. \code{\link{\%>.\%}} is a very simple and efficient pipe
#' operator. \code{\link{\%>_\%}} is more complex. It forces conversion to
#' a **Flow** object inside a pipeline and automatically manage non-standard
#' evaluation through creation and unquoting of **quosure**s for named arguments
#' whose name ends with `_`.
#'
#' @param x Value or **Flow** object to pass to the pipeline.
#' @param expr Expression to evaluation in the pipeline.
#'
#' @export
#' @name pipe_operator
#' @details With \code{\%>.\%}, the value must be explicitly indicated with a
#' `.` inside the expression. The expression is **not** modified, but the value
#' is first assigned into the calling environment as `.` (warning! possibly
#' replacing any existing value... do **not** use `.` to name other objects).
#' Also the expression is saved as `.call` in the calling environment so that
#' `debug_flow()` can retrieve are rerun it easily. If a **Flow** object is used
#' with \code{\%>.\%}, the `.value` is extracted from it into `.` first (and
#' thus the **Flow** object is lost).
#'
#' In the case of \code{\%>_\%} the **Flow** object is passed or created, it is
#' also assigned in the calling environment as `..`. This can be used to refer
#' to **Flow** object content within the pipeline expressions (e.g., `..$var`).
#'
#' For \code{\%>_\%}, the expression is reworked in such a way that a suitable
#' lazyeval syntax is constructed for each variable whose name ends with `_`,
#' and that variable is explicitly searched starting from `..`. Thus, `x_` is
#' replaced by `!!..$x`. For such variables appearing at left of an `=` sign, it
#' is also replaced by `:=` to keep correct \R syntax (`var_ =` =>
#' `!!..$var :=`). This way, you just need to follow special variables by `_`,
#' both in the `flow()` function arguments (to create quosures), and to the
#' NSE expressions used inside the pipeline to get the job done! The raw
#' expression is saved as `.call_raw`, while the reworked call is saved as
#' `.call` for possible further inspection and debugging.
#'
#' Finally, for \code{\%>_\%}, if `expr` is `.`, then, the last value from the
#' pipe is extracted from the **Flow** object and returned. It is equivalent,
#' thus, to `flow_obj$.value`.
#'
#' You can mix \code{\%>.\%} and \code{\%>_\%} within the same pipeline. In case
#' you use \code{\%>.\%} with a flow pipeline, it "unflows" it, extracting
#' `.value` from the **Flow** object and further feeding it to the pipeline.
