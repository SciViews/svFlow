#' Create and manipulate quosures easily
#'
#' @description  Quosures are defined in {rlang} package as part of the tidy
#' evaluation of non-standard expressions (see [quo()]). Here, we provide an
#' alternate mechanism using `-~expr` as a synonym of `quo(expr)`. Also,
#' `+quo_obj` is equivalent to `!!quo_obj` in {rlang}, and ++quo_obj both
#' unquotes and evaluates it in the right environment. Quosures are keystone
#' objects in the tidy evaluation mechanism. So, they deserve a special, clean
#' and concise syntax to create and manipulate them.
#'
#' The `as_xxx()` and `is_xxx()` further ease the manipulation of **quosure**s
#' or related objects.
#'
#' @param x An expression
#' @param env An environment specified for scoping of the quosure.
#' @param e1 Unary operator member, or first member of a binary operator.
#' @param e2 Second member of a binary operator (not used here, except for `^`).
#' @param ... Further arguments passed to the `print()` method (not used yet).
#'
#' @return These functions build or manipulated **quosure**s and return such
#' objects. `+quosure` creates an **unquoted** object. The `+` unary operator
#' applied to **unquoted** objects evaluate the expression contained in the
#' **quosure** in the right environment.
#'
#' @details `-` is defined as an unary minus operator for **formula** objects
#' (which is *not* defined in base R, hence, not supposed to be used otherwise).
#' Thus, `-~expr` just converts a formula build using the base `~expr`
#' instruction into a **quosure**. `as.quosure()` does the same, when the
#' expression is provided directly, and allows also to define the enclosing
#' environment (by default, it is the environment where the code is evaluated,
#' and it is also the case when using `-~expr`).
#'
#' Similarly, the unary `+` operator is defined for **quosure** in order to
#' easily "reverse" the mechanism of quoting an expression with a logical
#' complementary operator. It does something similar to `!!` in {rlang}, but
#' it can be used outside of tidy eval expressions. Since unary `+` has higher
#' syntax precedence than `!` in R, it is less susceptible to require
#' parentheses (only `^` for exponentiation, indexing/subsetting operators like
#' `$` or `[`, and namespace operators `::` and `:::` have higher precedence). A
#' specific `^` operator for quosures solves the precedence issue. `::` or `:::`
#' are very unlikely used in the context.
#'
#' `++quosure` is indeed a two-steps operation (`+(+quosure)`). It first
#' unquotes the quosure, returning an **unquoted** object. Then, the second `+`
#' evaluates the **unquoted** object. This allows for fine-graded manipulation
#' of **quosure**s: you can unquote at one place, and evaluate the **unquoted**
#' object elsewhere (and, of course, the contained expression is always
#' evaluated in the _right_ environment, despite all these manipulations).
#'
#' `!!` and just evaluates its argument and passes the result. It is only useful
#' inside a quasi-quoted argument, see \code{\link[rlang]{quasiquotation}}.
